#!/bin/bash
# Recursively codesigns every Mach-O binary under a vendored-resource tree
# (native .node addons, vendored CLIs, and any nested .app bundles) with the
# Developer ID identity, hardened runtime, and a secure timestamp. Required
# for notarization: Apple rejects the app if any embedded executable is
# unsigned, ad-hoc signed, or missing the hardened runtime / timestamp.
#
# Renamed from sign-sidecar-binaries.sh during sidecar removal (Phase 8) --
# same script, generalized: it originally signed the sidecar's own (much
# larger) resource tree, this now signs just the 3 managed-auth CLI
# packages under src-tauri/resources/managed-cli/ (see
# prepare-managed-cli-runtime.mjs). The `rusty-node` entitlements case is
# dropped -- that bundled Node runtime no longer exists anywhere in this
# tree once the sidecar is gone.
#
# Claude and Copilot additionally need the JIT entitlements in
# runtime-entitlements.plist: without them, their JIT-compiled JS engines
# (Bun, V8) can't reserve executable memory under hardened runtime and
# crash as soon as they're invoked (confirmed via "SharedArrayBuffer is not
# defined" and "Failed to reserve virtual memory for CodeRange"). This runs
# once, before Tauri's own build/notarize step, which never re-signs these
# files afterward - so there's exactly one signing pass.
